YOLO Road Damage Detection
Overview
This project implements YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect road damages using a given dataset and annotations present in Firebase Realtime Database. Y
OLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image simultaneously.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Firebase Python SDK

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-road-damage-detection.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset Preparation
Obtain the road damage dataset along with annotations.
Ensure the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., COCO format).
Upload the annotations to Firebase Realtime Database.

Configuration
Modify the config.py file to configure the necessary parameters for training and prediction.
Update Firebase credentials in config.py to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.
Training
Run the following command to start training the YOLO model:

python train.py
The trained model will be saved in the specified directory.

Prediction
To make predictions using the trained model, run the model

python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
Replace <path_to_image> with the path to the image you want to predict road damages on.

Predictions will be displayed on the image along with confidence scores.
